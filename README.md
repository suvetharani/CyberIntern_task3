# üîç Vulnerability Scan on Personal Computer

## üßæ Overview

This project demonstrates a basic vulnerability assessment of a personal computer using a free vulnerability scanner(Nessus). The goal is to identify potential security weaknesses, analyze the scan report, and document the most critical issues with their possible fixes.

---

## üéØ Objective

To identify potential vulnerabilities on a personal computer using a free vulnerability scanning tool, analyze the scan results, and document the most critical security issues along with appropriate mitigation strategies to enhance system security.

## üõ† Tools Used

- [Nessus Essentials](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials)

## üß™ Procedure

1. **Installation**  
   Installed Nessus Essentials / OpenVAS on the local machine.

2. **Setup Scan Target**  
   Configured the target IP as  `192.168.56.1` (local), and `123.123.123.123` (external test host).

3. **Launch Full Scan**  
   Started a full vulnerability scan, which took approximately 30‚Äì60 minutes.

4. **Analyze Results**  
   Reviewed the scan report focusing on *critical* and *high-severity* vulnerabilities.

5. **Mitigation Research**  
   Researched recommended solutions for each vulnerability using CVE references.

6. **Documentation**  
   Reports and screenshots are saved in the `/screenshots` directories.

## üìÑ Deliverables

- ‚úÖ HTML report for external host `123.123.123.123`
- ‚úÖ CSV report for local host `192.168.56.1`
- ‚úÖ Screenshots of Scan Results
- ‚úÖ Summary of Critical Vulnerabilities
- ‚úÖ Suggested Fixes / Mitigations

## üì∏ Screenshots

> Screenshots of the scan interface, summary, and critical vulnerabilities can be found in the `/screenshots` directory.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

The vulnerability scan successfully identified multiple security risks on the system. A separate external IP (`123.123.123.123`) was also scanned to explore additional real-world vulnerabilities. The results emphasize the importance of regular vulnerability scanning and keeping systems updated to maintain strong security.
