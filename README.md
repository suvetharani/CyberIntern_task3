# üîç Vulnerability Scan on Personal Computer

## üßæ Overview

This project demonstrates a basic vulnerability assessment of a personal computer using a free vulnerability scanner (Nessus Essentials or OpenVAS). The goal is to identify potential security weaknesses, analyze the scan report, and document the most critical issues with their possible fixes.

---

## üéØ Objective

To identify potential vulnerabilities on a personal computer using a free vulnerability scanning tool, analyze the scan results, and document the most critical security issues along with appropriate mitigation strategies to enhance system security.

## üß™ Procedure

1. **Installation**  
   Installed Nessus Essentials / OpenVAS on the local machine.

2. **Setup Scan Target**  
   Configured the target IP as `123.123.123.123` or local IP (e.g., `192.168.x.x`).

3. **Launch Full Scan**  
   Started a full vulnerability scan, which took approximately 30‚Äì60 minutes.

4. **Analyze Results**  
   Reviewed the scan report focusing on *critical* and *high-severity* vulnerabilities.

5. **Mitigation Research**  
   Researched recommended solutions for each vulnerability using CVE references.

6. **Documentation**  
   Screenshots and key findings are documented in the `/report` folder.
